Demonstrates: 		Optimized indexed triangle list exporting

Short Description:	Shows the performance increase when using optimized indexed triangle lists

Full Description:
Shows a textured model rendered in two different modes: one using a non optimized triangle list and one using an optimized triangle list.

The demo switches mode after a few seconds or after the user presses the action key. Both model data were generated with the PVRMAXExport plug-in utility from the SDK. The optimized triangle list case was generated using the PVRTTriStrip triangle sorting option from PVRMAXExport. MBX devices with up-to-date drivers should show higher performance in the optimized triangle list case. Note that the performance difference will not be visible on PC Emulation builds!
